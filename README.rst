Conda CI build scripts
======================

This project is a variant on the `python-appveyor-conda-example <https://github.com/rmcgibbo/python-appveyor-conda-example/>`_.
It builds upon the travis ci components of that example to include Anaconda Cloud labeling based on the tagged state of the commit being built.

Further concepts behind this idea can be seen in my talk on `Automated deployment of Python packages for development <https://youtu.be/-I-xFCBL8n8?t=3m58s>`_. The talk covers the specific tooling my section at work uses, but as mentioned at the end of the talk the concepts can be applied to alternative technologies for a similar workflow.
